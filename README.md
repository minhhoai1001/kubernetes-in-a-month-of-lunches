# Learn Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches
## about this book
Kubernetes is a vast subject, but I’ve taught it for years in training sessions and work-
shops, both in-person and virtual, and built out an incremental learning path that I
know works. We’ll start with the core concepts and gradually add more detail, saving
the most complex topics for when you’re more comfortable with Kubernetes.

Chapters 2 through 6 jump in to running apps on Kubernetes. You’ll learn how to
define applications in YAML manifests, which Kubernetes runs as containers. You’ll
understand how to configure network access for containers to talk to each other and
for traffic from the outside world to reach your containers. You’ll learn how your apps
can read configuration from Kubernetes and write data to storage units managed by
Kubernetes and how you can scale your applications.

Chapters 7 through 11 build on the basics with subjects that deal with real-world
Kubernetes usage. You’ll learn how you can run containers that share a common envi-
ronment and how you can use containers to run batch jobs and scheduled jobs. You’ll
learn how Kubernetes supports automated rolling updates so you can release new
application versions with zero downtime and how to use Helm to provide a configu-
rable way to deploy your apps. You’ll also learn about the practicalities of building apps
with Kubernetes, looking at different developer workflows and continuous integration/
continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

Chapters 12 through 16 are all about production readiness, going beyond just run-
ning your apps in Kubernetes to running them in a way that’s good enough to go live.
You’ll learn how to configure self-healing applications, collect and centralize all your
logs, and build monitoring dashboards to visualize the health of your systems. Security
is also in here, and you’ll learn how to secure public access to your apps as well as how
to secure the applications themselves.

Chapters 17 to 21 move into expert territory. Here you’ll learn how to work with
large Kubernetes deployments and configure your applications to automatically scale
up and down. You’ll learn how to implement role-based access control to secure
access to Kubernetes resources, and we’ll cover some more interesting uses of Kuber-
netes: as a platform for serverless functions and as a multiarchitecture cluster that can
run apps built for Linux and Windows, Intel, and Arm.
